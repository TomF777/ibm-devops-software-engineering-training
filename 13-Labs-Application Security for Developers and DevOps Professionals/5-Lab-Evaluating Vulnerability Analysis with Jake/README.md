Performing a vulnerability analysis can help you identify vulnerabilities lurking inside your app before it goes live.

A vulnerability analysis involves a systematic and thorough review of possible known weaknesses or vulnerabilities in a system or application. Revealing vulnerabilities is the first step in remedying the issue and developing a secure system.

For this lab, the applications you will use are:
- `Jake`, a vulnerability scanner developed by the SonaType Nexus Community

- Hit Counter (a sample web application)

## Install the Jake tool
```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y python3-venv
```

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
```
pip install jake
```

Run jake to make sure that it works:
```
jake
```

## Install the code to scan
```
cd ycuer-flask-hitcounter
```

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running a Vulnerability Scan

You can run jake on the code to see what vulnerabilities we might find. Jake can run in several modes. The `ddt` mode does static scanning for vulnerable dependencies, which is what we are looking to find.

```
jake ddt
```

## Interpreting the Results
The scan collected information on multiple packages that this application uses either directly or indirectly and uncovered several vulnerabilities.

It then provided details on the 7 vulnerabilities with the name of the package that is vulnerable, details about the vulnerability, including URLs to further investigate what the vulnerability is, and how it can be remediated.
